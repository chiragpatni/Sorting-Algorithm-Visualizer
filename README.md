In this project, you can look how the different sorting algorithms work.

There are lines or rectangular blocks of different length, you can shuffle them to place them in an unsorted way. When you will sort them, the algorithms will start their work and will sort the lines and you can see the process that how ther're working.

Available options : 
1. You can select the sorting algorithm according to your choice (Choice is limited, there are only 5 types of sorting algorithms available in this project).

2. You can select the number of lines that you want to sort (range is limited i.e., from 2 to 999).

3. You can select the way in which you want your lines or rectangular blocks to appear. You can choose one among the 3 categories i.e., shuffled(recommended) , range and reverse. Shuffle will place the lines or rectangular blocks in an unsorted way while range will place them in ascending order (already in sorted form) and reverse will place them in descending order and then it will sort them in ascending order.

4. You can pause an ongoing sorting to check on which line or rectangular block, our algorithm is currently working. 

5. You can choose the next button to see the the next step of the algorithm process. This option is provided in order to help you to understand the working of the algorithm as the working of algorithms are very fast which can confuse you that what just happened. So you can use next button and see the steps one by one with a lower pace.

NOTE : Some error may occur if you'll choose the options in wrong way, if such a situation occurs, then please refresh the page.
